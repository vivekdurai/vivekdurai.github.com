After sprinting ahead at break neck pace for 20 days, I took a break from coding up Contracts.io and decided to attend a Chennai Geeks meetup. And it was rewarding. Organized at RailsFactory's new office in Royapettah, the meet had Senthil Nayagam of RailsFactory introducing Ruby Motion (included a short demo) and a general discussion on javascript frameworks. \r\n\r\nIt was interesting how there was a range of perspectives on what frameworks like Backbonejs bring to the table especially in the context of realtime applications. The session ended with intros and suggestions from each and every attendee on how we could spice up the meetups and increase attendance at future meetups. Everyone actually seemed more alive at the end  of the session than before it. \r\n\r\nIt helped that Senthil had generously organized Pizzas post meetup!\r\n","note":"Don't delete this file!
